## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and configured to use TypeScript.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Kip-rotich46/quiz-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd quiz-app
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

## API Integration

The quiz questions are fetched from the Open Trivia Database API based on the specified amount and difficulty.

## Types and Enums

The app defines several TypeScript types and enums to manage the data:

- **Question**: Represents a quiz question.
- **Difficulty**: Enum for question difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- **QuestionsState**: Extends `Question` with an additional `answers` field.

## Utility Functions

The app includes utility functions like `shuffleArray` to shuffle the answers for each question.
